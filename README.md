# TicTacToe

# Worked on this online Tic Tac Toe game🎮, in parallel with web development sessions by GDSC PCCoE.

# It's always fun to make something creative and along the way, do so much problem-solving and learn something new😁.

# I had very little knowledge and practice of javascript but I learned so much of it just by making this project🙌.
